# mQACC Living Guidance
This is the repository intended to house mQACCs living guidance document. The text of the document itself is still being finalised by the Living Guidance organising committee of mQACC. We intend to use this repository in tandem with Gitbook, using the application and bidrectional syncing functionality for the markdown files.

The aim of the living guidance document is to support the untargeted metabolomics community in all aspects of Quality Assurance and Quality Control.
'Living' document means that it will be added to and revised periodically.
It includes
- Minimum requirements  
- Optional best practices
- Examples of use/case studies
- Glossary
- Non-prescriptive in style

The mission statement of mQACC is "*to engage the metabolomics community to communicate and promote the development, dissemination and harmonization of best QA/QC practices in untargeted metabolomics*". One of the main deliverables to this end is the Living Guidance document.


### Publications

Several journal publications summarise the work undertaken to establish best practices when designing untargeted metabolomics experiments.
